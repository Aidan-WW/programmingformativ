Interest of content - weak
-----------------------------
  The content is absolutely gripping, however there needs to be much more of it to make staying on the web page worth while.
Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Unacceptable
--------------------------------------------------------------
  The website's theme is clearly 1991 era websites, with almost no styling to be found, not that it is needed as the content almost certainly makes up for the lacklaster design.
  The design could be improved by using styling, whether a minimilist style is desired or not, css can be used to make the content easier to read and general make the website more pleasant to browse. it can also be used to ensure that the website is up to accessability standards.
Quality of written presentation - Excellent
-------------------------------------------------
  The website uses headers to make what the content talks about very clear, not much can be improved here.
Validity of HTML - Good
--------------------------
  The html is done with a fairly good level of quality, indents are used correctly and there appears not to be any problems with the formmating of the HTML. The website might benefit from using an independant CSS file rather in in the head of the HTML documents.
Evidence of collaboration - Exemplary
---------------------------------------
  The collaborations used are evident clearly all throughout the repo
